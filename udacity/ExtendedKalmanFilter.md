### **[Extended Kalman Filter](https://github.com/bitsurgeon/CarND_ExtendedKalmanFilter)**  

A sensor fusion pipeline for moving object tracking with combined measurements from LIDAR and RADAR.

Some of the highlights of the projects:

* Implemented [Extended Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter) in C++
* Estimate object's position and velocity with RADAR and LIDAR measurements
* Use popular linear algebra library [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php)

Here is a video demostration of the network.

- LIDAR measurements are red circles
- RADAR measurements are blue circles with an arrow pointing in the direction of the observed angle
- estimation markers are green triangles
