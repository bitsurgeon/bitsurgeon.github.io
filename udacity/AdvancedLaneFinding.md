### **[Advanced Lane Finding](https://github.com/bitsurgeon/CarND_AdvancedLaneLines)**

An updated image/video processing pipeline using advanced computer vision fuctions to identify lane bondaries from dashcam recordings.  

The following key concepts are explored:
* Camera calibration
* Distortion correction
* Color spaces and gradients
* Perspective transform and recovery
* Polynomial fitting
* Pixel-to-meter conversion and calculation
* Sliding window and histogram
* Weighted moving averaging

An example of a raw camera image is shown in below, as well as a processed image with lane boundaries detected. The radius of the curvature and the vehicle position relative to the center of the road are displayed onto the image as well.
