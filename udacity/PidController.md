### **[PID Controller](https://github.com/bitsurgeon/CarND_PIDController)**

Use a [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) controller to drive a car that following a target trajectory along a lakeside track.

Some of the highlights of the project:

- PID control theory exploration.
- Manual hyper-parameters tuning.
- Twiddle algorithm to fine tune hyper-parameter set.

Here is a video demonstration.

The demo above shows a test drive using a fine tuned hyper-parameter set in low speed mode. The can is following the target trajectory quite well.
