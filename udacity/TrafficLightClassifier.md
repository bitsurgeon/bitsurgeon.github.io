### **[Traffic Light Classifier](https://github.com/bitsurgeon/CarND_TrafficLightClassifier)**

This project is to train a traffic light classifier end-to-end for testing on Lincoln MKZ. The CNN trained is a SSD model for traffic light state classification using learning transfer from pre-trained MobileNet models using Google TensorFlow Object Detection API.

Since it is an end-to-end CNN training, the following key stages are involved:

- Dataset collection and purify
- Labeling and record file generation
- Model preparsion and training
- Model graph export
- Inference and validation
