### **[Capstone Project](https://github.com/bitsurgeon/CarND_Capstone)**

This capstone project is to program a real self-driving car, the Lincoln MKZ, and make it drive around a parking lot with traffic lights recognition. A group of five engineers are working on various part of the system, including drive-by-wire, waypoints following, traffic light detection and classification. The team has prepared a nice writeup on the system and our implementation at this [page](https://github.com/bitsurgeon/CarND_Capstone/blob/master/README.md).

The traffic light classification is achieved by using a neural network. I have documented the details in this [page](https://github.com/bitsurgeon/CarND_TrafficLightClassifier). It provides and end-to-end model training procedures, covering development environment setup, data collection, feature labeling, model training, model exporting and final inference.
